Listen to your heart
when he’s calling for you
Listen to your heart
there’s nothing else you can do

I don't know where you're going and I don't know why
But listen to your heart before you tell him goodbye

Sometimes you wonder if this fight is worthwhile
The precious moments are all lost in the tide, yeah
